This is a placeholder repo for the Linux driver for MediaTek MT7601U USB dongle. The driver was written from scratch based on the vendor GPL-driver. Unlike the vendor driver it uses modern Linux WiFi infrastructure and should work flawlessly with NetworkManager, wicd, wpa_supplicant and such. This driver was merged into mainline and is part of official Linux kernel since version v4.2 (August 2015).

Please report any issues upstream to the Linux Wireless community. This repo is no longer used.
